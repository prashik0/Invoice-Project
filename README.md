- Created two Django models viz. Invoice and Invoice Detail. (https://github.com/prashik0/Invoice-Project/blob/main/core/invoice/models.py)
- Created Views and Serializers.
- Created APIs using Django Rest Framework for all the HTTP methods for the invoice models. 
- The API should also accept invoice_details in the payload and create/update the associated invoice details too 
- Created test cases to test all the API endpoints.
